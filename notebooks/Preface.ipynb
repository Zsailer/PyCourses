    "Frankly, I've found most of the programming courses I've taken to be dull and irrelevant. Don't get me wrong, they were teaching information useful to someone I'm sure, just not to me. \n",

    "You see, I'm a **scientist**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for anything I do comes from a desire to answer questions. If I'm going to learn a new skill, like programming, it better help me answer questions more effectively. In my experience, it took professors too long to convince scientists that the time they were spending to learn programming was worth the advantage it could offer. The students lost interest before they made it to the good stuff!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, these classes are my attempt to retroactively teach programming in Python to scientists. That is, I'm going equipt you to use Python immediately in your research, without diving into the nasty details of OOP (object-oriented programming... whatever that means, right?), datatypes, pointers, arrays, classes, subclasses, etc. For example, what's the first lesson?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson 1**: Let's load, plot, and analyze your data! \n",
    "\n",
    "What could be more useful than that as a scientist? Don't worry, you're not cheating the system. You're being efficient. I'll teach you all the other stuff later, if you choose to continue. And perhaps we'll sprinkle a little for-loops and if-else statements in the midst. My goal is that you'll learn to program like a computer scientist without even knowing it!"
