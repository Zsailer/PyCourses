In my experience, it took the professor too long to convince scientists that the time they were spending to learn programming was worth the advantage it could offer. The students lost interest before they made it to the good stuff!\n",

That is, I'm going equipt you to use Python immediately in your research, without diving into the nasty details of OOP (object-oriented programming... whatever that means, right?), datatypes, pointers, arrays, classes, subclasses, etc. For example, what's the first lesson?\n",

And perhaps we'll sprinkle a little for-loops and if-else statements in the midst. My goal is that you'll learn to program like a computer scientist without even knowing it!"
